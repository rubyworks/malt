== BlueCloth

Malt can render Markdown via BlueCltoh.

Lets say we have a Markdown document called 'test.md' containing:

  # Example

  This is an example of Markdown rendering.

Markdown documents are recognized by the +.markdown+ or +.md+ file extensions.
These engine used by setting the :engine option.

  html = Malt.render(:file=>'test.md', :engine=>:bluecloth)

  html.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')

We can access the file via the +Malt.file+ method. Markdown documents are
recognized by the +.markdown+ or +.md+ file extensions.

  mark = Malt.file('test.md', :engine=>:bluecloth)

We can the convert the document to a Malt Html object via the #to_html method.

  html = mark.to_html

Notice that the output is an instance of Malt::Format::HTML.

  html.class.assert == Malt::Format::HTML

And that by calling #to_s we can get the rendered HTML document.

  html.to_s.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')

Or we can convert the document directly to HTML via the #html method.

  out = mark.html

  out.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')
