== Textile Rendering

Malt supports Textile via RedCloth.

Lets say we have a Textile document called 'test.tt' containing ...

  h1. Example

  This is an example of Textile rendering.

We can redner the textile document via the universal render function.
Textile documents are recognized by the +.textile+ or +.tt+ extension.

  html = Malt.render(:file=>'tmp/test.tt')

  html.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')
