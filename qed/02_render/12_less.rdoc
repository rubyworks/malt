== LESS Rendering

Lets say we have a LESS document called 'test.less' containing:

  @brand_color: #4D926F;
  #header {
    color: @brand_color;
  }
  h2 {
    color: @brand_color;
  }

We can render it via Malt with #render.

  @css = Malt.render(:file=>'tmp/test.less')

And we can verify that @css is:

  #header, h2 { color: #4d926f; }

Look how concise that is. LESS is pretty slick.
