= Malt Textile Support

Malt supports Textile via either the RedCloth or the ___ backend.

Lets say we have an Textile document called 'test.tt' containing ...

  h1. Example

  This is an example of Textile rendering.

We can access the file via the +Malt.file+ method. Textile documents are
recognized by the +.textile+ or +.tt+ extension.

  tile = Malt.file('tmp/test.tt')

We can the convert the document to a Malt Html object via the #to_html method.

  html = tile.to_html

Notice that the output is an instance of Malt::Formats::HTML.

  html.class.assert == Malt::Formats::HTML

And that by calling #to_s we can get the rendered HTML document.

  html.to_s.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')

Or we can convert the document directly to HTML via the #html method.

  out = tile.html

  out.assert.include?('<h1>Example</h1>')
