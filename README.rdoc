= Malt

* home: http://rubyworks.github.com/malt


== DESCRIPTION

Malt provides a factory framework for rendering
a variety of template and markup document formats.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

Here's the idea:

  Malt.file('foo.erb').compile(db).to_s

Where +db+ is a data source of some type. Malt will see
that the file is an Erb template and render it accordingly.

Malt can also "double render".

  Malt.file('foo.rdoc.erb').compile2(db).to_html

How does malt know what to do with a file?

  Malt.register('*.erb', :Erb)

The first argument is a fnmatch string, the second is the name
of the Malt::Template or Malt::Markup subclass.

To render text via Malt you of course need to provide the
template or markup type.

  Malt.text(text, :erb).compile(db).to_s


== INSTALATION

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  $ gem install  

For a site install you will need Ruby Setup and the compressed
packages (tar.gz or zip usually). Uncompress the package
cd into it and run setup.rb, e.g.

  $ tar -xvzf malt-x.y.z.tgz
  $ cd malt-x.y.z.tgz
  $ sudo setup.rb
