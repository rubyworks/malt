= Introduction

Malt is a multi-template rendering framework. It provides two convenient
interfaces for working with backend template systems. The first is 
a functional interface via `Malt.render` method. And the second is an
object-oriented interface that can be easily constructed via the 
`Malt.file` or `Malt.text` methods.
